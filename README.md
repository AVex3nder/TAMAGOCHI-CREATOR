# TAMAGOCHI CREATOR

This is a personal project to help me learn more about how to implement gamified features in apps.

## Getting started

This project is built in <a href="https://reactnative.dev/" >React Native</a>.
In order to run the build, you first need to <a href="https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup">set up the development environment</a>.

Once your system is all set up, follow these <a href="https://reactnative.dev/docs/running-on-device">steps</a>:

## How it works

The home screen is the selector form where you can choose a Sprite for the Tamagochi and a Background, out of the few pre-set ones.
Once you made your choice, just tap the 'GO TO GAME!' button and the game begins!
In the game, you have 3 buttons: first one is for food, middle one is play-pause, and right one is for picking up the poop.
Try to make your Tamagochi survive!

## Features still being developed

Backend:

- server and database
- user CRUD and authentication
- upload of own sprites and backgrounds

Frontend:

- login/register screen and user dashboard
- more complex game cycle: sleep, disease...
- game score and highscores
